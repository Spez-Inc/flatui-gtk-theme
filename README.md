Paper Theme
===========

FlatUI is a modern desktop theme suite. Its design is mostly flat with a minimal use of shadows for depth.

FlatUI has been developed primarily with modern GTK3 (GNOME-based) desktop environments in mind, legacy-toolkit and GTK2 environments will not provide an ideal experience, as much of the visual design relies on modern GTK3+ widgets.

FlatUI is distributed under the terms the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL v.3).
